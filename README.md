# Spatial Analasis End To End Downstream Samples

The code will provive you a step-by-step guide to create sample downstream pipelines for Spatial Analysis events and leverage the SA insights for the following three scenarios:

1. Data Analytics
2. Real Time Event Processing
3. Data Warehousing

These solution are meant to speed-up ETL development and simplify how you design your downstream Spatial Analysis insights pipelines. Also how you can take advantage of a combination of Azure services to build a complete solution.

# Data Analytics

The Data Analytics solution provides pipelines for the following operations:

### 1. Real Time Person Count Power BI Dashboard:

    Ingest insights from Azure Event Hub, Transfrom them in Azure Stream Analytics and Load them into a Real Time PowerBI Dashboard. This sample is implemented for the Person Count operation but can be easily modified to use the other Spatial Analasis Operations.

[Setup Steps](RealTimePowerBI.md)

## Requirements

- Access to Azure account with permission to create Azure services
- Permission to install PowerShell components in your local computer
- A Power BI Pro license

Around 30 minutes are required to deploy this solution.

# Real Time Event Processing

# Data Warehousing

### 1. Archieve Data into Azure Table storage:

    Ingest insights from Azure Event Hub, Transfrom them in Azure Stream Analytics and Load them into Azure Table storage.
